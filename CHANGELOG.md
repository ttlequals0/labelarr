# Changelog

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- `MOVIE_LIBRARY_EXCLUDE` / `TV_LIBRARY_EXCLUDE`: comma-separated library
  IDs to skip when `*_PROCESS_ALL=true`. Excluded libraries are filtered
  from both timer-driven processing and webhook routing.
- `WEBHOOK_ONLY=true`: skips the startup full scan and the periodic timer
  entirely, leaving the webhook server as the only trigger. Requires
  `WEBHOOK_ENABLED=true`.

### Fixed
- Webhook items are no longer silently dropped when a full library scan is
  in progress. `ProcessSingleItem` now waits for the per-library slot to
  free up (polling every 5s, bounded to a 2-hour deadline) instead of
  logging a fake "queuing for next cycle" and returning early.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

#### Plex Webhook Support
- Webhook listener for real-time processing (WEBHOOK_ENABLED, WEBHOOK_PORT)
- Handles library.new and library.on.deck events
- Configurable debounce window (WEBHOOK_DEBOUNCE, default 30s)
- Prevents concurrent processing of the same library
- Health check endpoint at /health
- Runs alongside the existing timer

#### Keyword Prefix
- KEYWORD_PREFIX env var to prepend text to keywords (e.g. "- ")
- Useful when UPDATE_FIELD=genre to separate TMDb keywords from real genres

#### Batch Processing
- BATCH_SIZE (default 100) and BATCH_DELAY (default 10s) env vars
- Prevents API flooding on large libraries (4000+ items)
- ITEM_DELAY (default 500ms) controls per-item pacing

#### Version Tracking
- Version constant in internal/version/version.go
- Logs version on startup

### Changed
- Removed all emoji from log output; replaced with bracketed tags
- Extracted Clients struct for processor initialization
- Added keyword cache by TMDb ID to avoid redundant API calls
- Eliminated redundant Plex API call after keyword sync for export

## 2025-07-05

### Added

#### Radarr/Sonarr Integration
- Radarr API client (internal/radarr/) -- movie lookup by title, year, TMDb ID, IMDb ID, file path
- Sonarr API client (internal/sonarr/) -- series lookup by title, year, TMDb ID, TVDb ID, IMDb ID, file path
- USE_RADARR, USE_SONARR, RADARR_URL, RADARR_API_KEY, SONARR_URL, SONARR_API_KEY env vars
- TMDb ID extraction chain: Plex metadata -> Radarr/Sonarr -> file path regex
- Connection testing on startup for all enabled services

#### Verbose Logging
- VERBOSE_LOGGING env var (default false)
- Shows TMDb ID lookup source, Plex GUIDs, matching attempts
- Progress percentage for libraries over 100 items

#### Persistent Storage
- JSON file storage for processed items (DATA_DIR env var)
- Tracks rating key, TMDb ID, update field, last processed time
- Skips already-processed items unless FORCE_UPDATE=true
- Runs in ephemeral mode when DATA_DIR is not set

#### Keyword Normalization
- Pattern-based normalization: sci-fi -> Sci-Fi, romcom -> Romantic Comedy
- Acronym detection (FBI, CIA, DEA, etc.)
- Century formatting (5th century bc -> 5th Century BC)
- City/state, relationship, and credit stinger patterns
- 90+ test cases
- Duplicate cleaning: removes old unnormalized keywords when normalized versions are added

#### Force Update Mode
- FORCE_UPDATE env var (default false)
- Reprocesses all items regardless of storage state

#### Export Functionality
- EXPORT_LABELS, EXPORT_LOCATION, EXPORT_MODE (txt/json) env vars
- Generates file lists per label per library
- JSON mode outputs a single structured export.json
- TXT mode creates per-library subdirectories with summary.txt

### Changed
- NewProcessor accepts optional Radarr/Sonarr clients and returns error
- TMDb client normalizes keywords before returning them
- Removal delay reduced from 500ms to configurable ITEM_DELAY

### Technical Notes
- Radarr/Sonarr use API v3
- All new features are optional and backward compatible
- No breaking changes to existing configuration
