## Quick Start

```yaml
services:
  labelarr:
    image: ghcr.io/nullable-eth/labelarr:latest
    container_name: labelarr
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./labelarr-data:/data
    environment:
      - PLEX_TOKEN=your_plex_token_here
      - TMDB_READ_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_tmdb_read_access_token
      - PLEX_SERVER=plex
      - PLEX_PORT=32400
      - PLEX_REQUIRES_HTTPS=true
      - MOVIE_PROCESS_ALL=true
      - TV_PROCESS_ALL=true
```

Run `docker-compose up -d`. Labelarr processes your libraries immediately on startup, then repeats every hour.

## How It Works

1. Fetches all movies/shows from your Plex libraries
2. Finds the TMDb ID for each item (from Plex metadata, Radarr/Sonarr, or file paths)
3. Pulls keywords from the TMDb API
4. Normalizes keyword formatting (capitalization, acronyms, known patterns)
5. Adds keywords as Plex labels or genres -- never removes existing values
6. Tracks what has been processed to skip it next time

Runs on a configurable timer (default 1h). With webhooks enabled, also processes immediately when Plex adds new media.

## Radarr/Sonarr Integration

If your file paths don't contain TMDb IDs, Labelarr can look them up through Radarr and Sonarr's APIs. The lookup chain is:

1. Plex metadata (fastest)
2. Radarr/Sonarr API (title/year match, then IMDb/TVDb ID, then file path)
3. File path regex (fallback)

This means you don't need to rename any files. Enable it by setting `USE_RADARR=true` and/or `USE_SONARR=true` with the corresponding URL and API key.

File path detection is faster than API calls. If your filenames already include TMDb IDs (e.g. `{tmdb-603}`), you don't need this.

API keys: Radarr/Sonarr Settings > General > Security > API Key.

## Webhook Support

**Requires Plex Pass.** Instead of waiting for the next timer tick, Labelarr can react to Plex webhook events immediately.

```yaml
environment:
  - WEBHOOK_ENABLED=true
  - WEBHOOK_PORT=9090
  - WEBHOOK_DEBOUNCE=30s
ports:
  - "9090:9090"
```

Configure Plex to send webhooks to `http://labelarr:9090/webhook` (Settings > Webhooks in Plex). Labelarr listens for `library.new` and `library.on.deck` events.

When multiple events arrive for the same library in quick succession (common during bulk imports), the debounce window coalesces them into a single processing run.

The webhook server runs alongside the existing timer. Both can be active at the same time.

A health check is available at `/health`.

### Manual Scan Trigger

`POST /scan` on the webhook server kicks off a scan cycle without waiting for the timer. Useful when operating in `WEBHOOK_ONLY=true` mode or after extended downtime.

```bash
# Full scan of all non-excluded libraries
curl -X POST http://labelarr:9090/scan

# Scan a single library by Plex section ID
curl -X POST "http://labelarr:9090/scan?library=22"

# Scan a single library by name (case-insensitive)
curl -X POST "http://labelarr:9090/scan?library=Movies"
```

Responses:
- `202 Accepted` — scan started in the background
- `409 Conflict` — a scan is already in progress
- `404 Not Found` — `library` param did not match any configured library
- `405 Method Not Allowed` — non-POST request

## Batch Processing

Large libraries (4000+ items) can overwhelm Radarr/Sonarr APIs with thousands of requests. Batch processing breaks the work into chunks with pauses between them.

```yaml
environment:
  - BATCH_SIZE=100
  - BATCH_DELAY=10s
  - ITEM_DELAY=500ms
```

With 4000 items and a batch size of 100, Labelarr processes 100 items, pauses 10 seconds, processes the next 100, and so on. The per-item delay (default 500ms) paces individual API calls within each batch.

## Keyword Prefix

When using `UPDATE_FIELD=genre`, TMDb keywords get mixed in with real Plex genres in the filter dropdown. A prefix separates them visually:

```yaml
environment:
  - UPDATE_FIELD=genre
  - KEYWORD_PREFIX="- "
```

This turns `Sci-Fi` into `- Sci-Fi` in the genre list, so real genres sort to the top and keyword-derived genres cluster at the bottom.

The prefix is applied consistently during both add and remove operations.

## Keyword Normalization

TMDb keywords come in inconsistent formats. Labelarr normalizes them before applying:

- Title casing with proper article/preposition handling
- Acronym detection: `fbi` -> `FBI`, `cia` -> `CIA`
- Known replacements: `sci-fi` / `scifi` / `sci fi` -> `Sci-Fi`, `romcom` -> `Romantic Comedy`
- Relationship patterns: `father daughter` -> `Father Daughter Relationship`
- Century formatting: `5th century bc` -> `5th Century BC`
- Location formatting: `san francisco, california` -> `San Francisco, California`
- Credit stingers: `duringcreditsstinger` -> `During Credits Stinger`

When a normalized keyword replaces an old unnormalized version, the old one is automatically removed from Plex.

90+ test cases cover the normalization rules.

## Export Functionality

Generate file path lists for media matching specific labels. Useful for syncing specific genres to other devices or creating targeted backups.

```yaml
environment:
  - EXPORT_LABELS=action,comedy,thriller
  - EXPORT_LOCATION=/data/exports
  - EXPORT_MODE=txt
volumes:
  - ./exports:/data/exports
```

### Text mode (default)

Creates per-library subdirectories with one file per label:

```
/data/exports/
  summary.txt
  Movies/
    action.txt
    comedy.txt
  TV Shows/
    action.txt
    comedy.txt
```

Each file lists the full file paths of matching media.

### JSON mode

Creates a single `export.json` with structured data including file sizes and statistics.

Label matching is case-insensitive. Items with multiple matching labels appear in each corresponding file. Exported paths reflect Plex's internal filesystem, so you may need to translate container paths to host paths.

## TMDb ID Detection

Labelarr looks for TMDb IDs in file and folder names using a flexible regex. All of these work:

```
/movies/The Matrix (1999) {tmdb-603}/file.mkv
/movies/Inception (2010) [tmdb:27205]/file.mkv
/movies/Avatar (2009) tmdb19995/file.mkv
/movies/Interstellar (2014) (tmdb=157336)/file.mkv
/movies/The Dark Knight (2008) TMDB_155/file.mkv
```

Separators (`-`, `:`, `_`, `=`, space) and bracket styles (`{}`, `[]`, `()`) all work. Case-insensitive.

Will not match: `mytmdb12345` (preceded by letters), `tmdb` (no digits), `tmdb12345abc` (followed by letters).

### Radarr naming format

To include TMDb IDs in Radarr-managed files, set the folder format to:

```
{Movie CleanTitle} ({Release Year}) {tmdb-{TmdbId}}
```

For existing libraries, use Radarr's mass rename feature to apply the new format.

## Removing Keywords

`REMOVE=lock` or `REMOVE=unlock` runs a single pass that removes TMDb keywords from the configured field, then exits.

- `lock`: removes keywords, keeps the field locked (Plex can't overwrite)
- `unlock`: removes keywords, unlocks the field (Plex can refresh it)

Only TMDb-sourced keywords are removed. Custom labels you added manually are preserved.

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e PLEX_TOKEN=... -e TMDB_READ_ACCESS_TOKEN=... \
  -e REMOVE=lock -e UPDATE_FIELD=label \
  -e MOVIE_PROCESS_ALL=true \
  ghcr.io/nullable-eth/labelarr:latest
```

## Field Locking

Labelarr locks the label/genre field after writing to prevent Plex from overwriting keywords during metadata refreshes. Locked fields show a lock icon in the Plex UI.

You can still edit locked fields manually in Plex. External tools (including Labelarr) can also modify them.

![Example of locked genre field](example/genre.png)

## Force Update Mode

Set `FORCE_UPDATE=true` to reprocess every item regardless of whether it was already processed. Useful after:

- Enabling keyword normalization on an existing library
- Switching between label and genre modes
- Wanting to refresh all keywords from TMDb

This bypasses both the storage check and the "already has all keywords" check.

## Verbose Logging

`VERBOSE_LOGGING=true` shows the full TMDb ID lookup chain for each item: which Plex GUIDs are available, Radarr/Sonarr lookup attempts, file path matching, and the source of the final match.

Useful for debugging why specific items aren't being matched.

## Persistent Storage

When `DATA_DIR` is set (e.g. `/data`), Labelarr saves processed items to a JSON file so it can skip them on restart. Without `DATA_DIR`, it runs in ephemeral mode and reprocesses everything each cycle.

Mount a volume to persist across container restarts:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./labelarr-data:/data
environment:
  - DATA_DIR=/data
```

## Getting API Keys

**Plex Token:** Open Plex Web, press F12, go to Network tab, refresh the page, and look for `X-Plex-Token` in any request header.

**TMDb:** Create an account at [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) and generate a Read Access Token.

**Radarr/Sonarr:** Settings > General > Security > API Key.

## Troubleshooting

**401 from Plex** -- Check your token. Try `PLEX_REQUIRES_HTTPS=false` for local servers.

**401 from TMDb** -- Make sure you're using the Read Access Token, not the API key.

**No TMDb ID found** -- Enable `VERBOSE_LOGGING=true` to see where the lookup fails. Either add TMDb IDs to your file paths, enable Radarr/Sonarr integration, or make sure Plex is using the TMDb agent.

**Container permission errors** -- If you see "mkdir /data: permission denied", either set `DATA_DIR` to a writable path with a mounted volume, or leave `DATA_DIR` unset to run in ephemeral mode.

**Large library crashes** -- Set `BATCH_SIZE` and `BATCH_DELAY` to reduce API pressure. The defaults (100 items, 10s pause) work for most setups.
